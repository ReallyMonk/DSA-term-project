# Project Description

## Motivation

Our goal is to implement a self-playing AI model for snake game.

## Algorithms

The idea of our algorithm comes from graph theory.

First, we are planning to implement three different pathfinding algorithms:

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- A* search

They are used to search a path from one node to another in a graph. But in our game the "snake" is a set of nodes.

So, then, we want to combine them with different strategies and build different self-playing AI models.

Finally, we would run those models on a snake game, test their performances, and try to find a optimal solution.


## Experiment

Several stages will be implemented:
- Construct the map.
- Generate the food.
- Design some algorithms for moving the snake.
- check the snake if it's dead.
- compare the advantages between algorithms.

We will compare complexity of several algorithms:

- BFS
- DFS
- A*
- some other greedy algorithms or search algorithms.
- ...

if possible, we can extend this to the Graph Model.
